Description: Implementations several algorithms for kernel k-means. The default
  'OTQT' algorithm is a fast alternative to standard implementations of kernel
  k-means, particularly in cases with many clusters. For a small number of
  clusters, the implemented 'MacQueen' method typically performs the fasest. For
  more details and performance evaluations, see Berlinski and Maitra (2025) <doi:10.1002/sam.70032>.
